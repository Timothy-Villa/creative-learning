# creative-learning
A cross-platform learning experience made with electron.atom.io

Hello and welcome to this open-source project we will be building. If you have been invited to this repo, you probably already know whats up. For those of you who are new, Welcome! 

## Getting Started 
To initialize the platform do the following: 
Before you do anything, download node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
Then you should probably install electron (https://electron.atom.io/)
* Fork the repo onto your machine
  * You can also clone it 
* Open up the file into your text editor. 
* In your terminal or command line, change the directory using 
`$ cd <path where forked files are>`
Then once again `cd` into "platform-application" 
* From that directory, you can now run the program using `npm start`
